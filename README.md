# call-logs-data-mobilehci-2016
This repository contains the dataset from our MobileHCI 2016 paper entitled: "Understanding call logs of smartphone users for making future calls". In this measurement study, we analyzed whether mobile phone
users exhibit temporal regularity in their mobile communication.
To this end, we collected a mobile phone usage dataset
from a developing country – Pakistan. The data consists of
about 800 ego profiles and 229450 communication events.


Data was collected from the general population of Pakistan using an android app called: Package Advisor. The shared data does not contain personally identifiable information.

The data file has the following columns:

srNo,user,contact,code,callDirection,callTime,callDate,callDay,dataDay,dataTime

The last two fields indicate the timestamp of when the data was downloaded.
